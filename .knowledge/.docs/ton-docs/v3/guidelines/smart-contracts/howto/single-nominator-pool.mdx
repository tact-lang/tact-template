# How to use Single Nominator Pool

:::tip
It's recommended to get acquainted with [Single Nominator Pool Specification](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/single-nominator-pool) before reading this tutorial.
:::

### Set up single-nominator

:::caution
Before start make sure you have topped up and [activated](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/validator-node#activate-the-wallets) validator's wallet.
:::

1. Enable single nominator mode

```bash
MyTonCtrl> enable_mode single-nominator
```

2. Check if single-nominator mode is enabled.

```bash
MyTonCtrl> status_modes
Name              Status             Description
single-nominator  enabled   Orbs's single nominator pools.
```

3. Create pool

```bash
MyTonCtrl> new_single_pool <pool-name> <owner_address>
```

If you have already created pool it's possible to import it:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> import_pool <pool-name> <pool-addr>
```

4. Type `pools_list` to display pool addresses

```bash
MyTonCtrl> pools_list
Name       Status  Balance  Version   Address
test-pool  empty   0.0      spool_r2  kf_JcC5pn3etTAdwOnc16_tyMmKE8-ftNUnf0OnUjAIdDJpX
```

5. Activate the pool

```bash
MyTonCtrl> activate_single_pool <pool-name>
```

After successfully activated pool:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> pools_list
Name       Status  Balance  Version   Address
test-pool  active  0.99389  spool_r2  kf_JcC5pn3etTAdwOnc16_tyMmKE8-ftNUnf0OnUjAIdDJpX
```

Now you can work with this pool via mytonctrl like with a standard nominator pool.

:::info
If the pool's balance is enough to participate in both rounds (`balance > min_stake_amount * 2`) then MyTonCtrl will automatically participate in both rounds using `stake = balance / 2`, unless user sets stake manually using command `set stake`. This behaviour is different from using a nominator pool but similar to staking using validator wallet.
:::

## Start without mytonctrl

#### Prepare launched Validator

  If you have mytonctrl installed and validator running:

  1. Stop validation and withdraw all funds.

#### Prepare from the beginning
  If you had no Validator before, do the following:
   1. [Run a Validator](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/full-node) and make sure it's synced.
   2. Stop validation and withdraw all funds.


### Prepare Single Nominator


1. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) v.16 and later and npm  ([detailed instructions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions))

2. Install `ts-node` and `arg` module

```bash
$ sudo apt install ts-node
$ sudo npm i arg -g
```

4. Create symlinks for compilers:

```bash
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ton/crypto/fift /usr/local/bin/fift
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ton/crypto/func /usr/local/bin/func
```

5. Run test to make sure everything is set up properly:

```bash
$ npm run test
```

6. Replace mytonctrl nominator-pool scripts: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orbs-network/single-nominator/main/mytonctrl-scripts/install-pool-scripts.sh

### Create Single Nominator Pool

1. Get Toncenter API key from a Telegram [@tonapibot](https://t.me/tonapibot)
2. Set env variables:

```bash
export OWNER_ADDRESS=<owner_address>
export VALIDATOR_ADDRESS=<validator_wallet_address>
export TON_ENDPOINT=https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC
export TON_API_KEY=<toncenter api key>
```

2. Create deployer address:

```bash
$ npm run init-deploy-wallet
Insufficient Deployer [EQAo5U...yGgbvR] funds 0
```

3. Topup deployer address with 2.1 TON
4. Deploy pool contract, you will get pool address: `Ef-kC0..._WLqgs`:

```
$ npm run deploy
```

5. Convert address to .addr:

```
$ fift -s ./scripts/fift/str-to-addr.fif Ef-kC0..._WLqgs
```

(Saving address to file single-nominator.addr)

6. Backup deployer private key "./build/deploy.config.json" and "single-nominator.addr" files
7. Copy "single-nominator.addr" to "mytoncore/pools/single-nominator-1.addr"
8. Send stake from owner address to single nominator address

### Withdrawals from Single Nominator

Using wallets to withdraw from Single Nominator
Fift:

1. Create "withdraw.boc" request with amount:

```bash
$ fift -s ./scripts/fift/withdraw.fif <withdraw_amount>
```

2. Create and sign request from owner's wallet:

```bash
$ fift -s wallet-v3.fif <my-wallet> <single_nominator_address> <sub_wallet_id> <seqno> <amount=1> -B withdraw.boc
```

3. Broadcast query:

```bash
$ lite-client -C global.config.json -c 'sendfile wallet-query.boc'
tons
```

1. Create "withdraw.boc" request with amount:

```bash
$ fift -s ./scripts/fift/withdraw.fif <withdraw_amount>
```

2. Send request to single nominator address:

a.

```bash
$ tons wallet transfer <my-wallet> <single_nominator_address> <amount=1> --body withdraw.boc
tonkeeper
```

b.

```
npm link typescript
```

c.

```
npx ts-node scripts/ts/withdraw-deeplink.ts <single-nominator-addr> <withdraw-amount>
```

d. Open deeplink on the owner's phone

## Deposit pool

You can make a deposit using **MyTonCtrl**, using the following commands:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> mg <from-wallet-name> <pool-account-addr> <amount>
```

or

```sh
MyTonCtrl> deposit_to_pool <pool-addr> <amount>
```

which deposits pool from validator wallet.

Or use the following steps:

1. Go to the poolâ€™s page https://tonscan.org/nominator/{pool_address}.

2. Make sure that the information about the pool is fully displayed, if the pool has the wrong smart contract, there will be no information.

3. Press the `ADD STAKE` button or scan the QR-code using Tonkeeper or any other TON Wallet.

4. After you are transferred to the wallet, please, enter the amount of TON and then send the transaction. After that TON coins will be added to staking.

If the wallet does not open automatically, you can send the transaction manually by copying the pool address. Send it through any TON wallet. From the sent transaction, 1 TON will be debited as a commission for processing the deposit.


## Withdraw funds

You can also withdraw funds using the following command:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> withdraw_from_pool <pool-addr> <amount>
```

Or you can create and send transaction manually:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="toncore" label="JS (@ton)">

```js
import { Address, beginCell, internal, storeMessageRelaxed, toNano } from "@ton/core";

async function main() {
    const single_nominator_address = Address.parse('single nominator address');
    const WITHDRAW_OP = 0x1000
    const amount = 50000

    const messageBody = beginCell()
        .storeUint(WITHDRAW_OP, 32) // op code for withdrawal
        .storeUint(0, 64)           // query_id
        .storeCoins(amount)         // amount to withdraw
        .endCell();

    const internalMessage = internal({
        to: single_nominator_address,
        value: toNano('1'),
        bounce: true,
        body: messageBody
    });
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="tonconnect" label="Golang">

```go
func WithdrawSingleNominatorMessage(single_nominator_address string, query_id, amount uint64) (*tonconnect.Message, error) {

	const WITHDRAW_OP = 0x1000

	payload, _ := cell.BeginCell().
		MustStoreUInt(WITHDRAW_OP, 32). // op code for withdrawal
		MustStoreUInt(query_id, 64).    // query_id
		MustStoreCoins(amount).         // amount to withdraw
		EndCell().MarshalJSON()

	msg, err := tonconnect.NewMessage(
		single_nominator_address,
		tlb.MustFromTON("1").Nano().String(), // nanocoins to transfer/compute message
		tonconnect.WithPayload(payload))

	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return msg, nil
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


## Election process

### Set up a Single Nominator Pool

Configure the Single Nominator Pool contract using the [following](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/single-nominator-pool#set-up-single-nominator) instructions.

### Join the elections

[Deposit](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/single-nominator-pool#deposit-pool) minimum stake amount to the Single Nominator Pool.

**MyTonCtrl** will automatically join the elections. You can set the stake amount that mytonctrl sends to the [Elector contract](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/governance#elector) ~ every 18 hours on Mainnet and 2 hours on Testnet.

```sh
MyTonCtrl> set stake 90000
```

**Minimum stake** amount could be found using `status` command.

![](/img/docs/single-nominator/tetsnet-conf.png)

You can set `stake` as `null` and it will be calculated according to the `stakePercent` value (could be checked with `status_settings` command).

It's possible to check is election has already been started:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> status
```

and for Testnet:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> status fast
```

As example:

![](/img/docs/single-nominator/election-status.png)


If the election has been started and Single Nominator Pool is activated, validator should **automatically** send **ElectorNewStake** message to the Elector contract at the beginning of the next round.

Check validator wallet:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> wl
Name                  Status  Balance           Ver  Wch  Address
validator_wallet_001  active  995.828585374     v1   -1   kf_dctjwS4tqWdeG4GcCLJ53rkgxZOGGrdDzHJ_mxPkm_Xct
```

Then check it transaction history:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> vas kf_dctjwS4tqWdeG4GcCLJ53rkgxZOGGrdDzHJ_mxPkm_Xct
Address                                           Status  Balance        Version
kf_dctjwS4tqWdeG4GcCLJ53rkgxZOGGrdDzHJ_mxPkm_Xct  active  995.828585374  v1r3

```

This **ElectorNewStake** transaction in Single Nominator contract history in Tonviewer:

![](/img/docs/single-nominator/new-stake.png)

On the above example **MyTonCtrl** automatically stake `90000` Toncoins on the Elector contract.

### Checking Validator Status

At the beginning of the next round check **MyTonCtrl** validator status with `status` command (`status fast` on Testnet).

![](/img/docs/single-nominator/status-validator.png)

You can confirm if your node has become a full validator by checking the following conditions:

1. **Validator Efficiency** - An efficiency of the local validator should be green and not `n/a`.
2. **Validator Index** - The validator index should be greater than -1.


### Checking profit

At the end of the round **MyTonCtrl** sends **ElectorRecoverStakeRequest** message to the Elector contract. It responses with `stake + profit` amount of Toncoins to your Single Nominator Pool.

![](/img/docs/single-nominator/validator-profit.png)

You can also check transactions history of your pool with `vas` command:

![](/img/docs/single-nominator/validator-profit-vas.png)

### Stop participating

If user doesn't want to take part in validating anymore:

1. Disable validator mode:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> disable_mode validator
```

2. [Withdraw](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/single-nominator-pool#withdraw-funds) all funds from the Single Nominator contract to the owner wallet.

## Transitioning a Regular Validator to Nominator Pool Mode

1. Disable `validator` mode to discontinue election participation.
2. Await the return of both your stakes from the elector.
3. Proceed with the following [steps](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/single-nominator-pool#set-up-single-nominator).

## Single Nominator Pool client

* There is a simple open-source client to deploy and interact with the contract - https://github.com/orbs-network/single-nominator-client
* If you run into trouble, you can ask the team for support on [Telegram](https://t.me/single_nominator)

## Run Single Nominator Pool with Vesting Contract

From the beginning, owner of Vesting Contract can manage it with his Wallet Contract.
In this scheme we will manage interaction of several contracts.

|Contracts|Interface for Managing|
|---|---|
|`validator_wallet` |Mytonctrl|
|`vesting` | [vesting.ton.org](https://vesting.ton.org/) |
|`owner_wallet`| app e.g.:Tonkeeper, MyTonWallet |
|`single_nominator_pool` |MyTonctrl|

*  `owner_wallet` - TON Wallet who own the `vesting`.

:::caution
Make Sure you have completely done back up for Vesting  `owner_wallet`'s recovery parse. Once  `owner_wallet` access lost, the access to managing `vesting` funds also lost and can't be recovered.
:::

1. Run a Full Node, wait sync node.
2. Enable Validator mode, get the wallet_v1 address was created due installation - retrieve this via `Mytonctrl wl`.
3. Send 200 TON(monthly expenses) to the `validator_wallet`.
4. Create `single_nominator_pool`:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> new_single_pool <pool-name> <vesting>
```

Example:

```
MyTonCtrl> new_single_pool my_s_pool EQD...lme-D
```

5. Activate `single_nominator_pool`:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> activate_single_pool <pool-name>
```

Example:

```
MyTonCtrl> activate_single_pool my_s_pool
```

6. After receiving the `single_nominator_pool` address on-chain, request to whitelist your `single_nominator_pool` person who send you Vesting contract.
7. Once your `single_nominator_pool` whitelisted, you will be able to send locked tokens from `vesting` contract to `single_nominator_pool` with [vesting.ton.org](https://vesting.ton.org/).
    - a.Connect with `owner_wallet` on [vesting.ton.org](https://vesting.ton.org/).
    - b.Make test deposit from `vesting` Send 10 TON to the `single_nominator_pool`.
    - c. Return remains(~8 TON) funds  back to `vesting` with message [amount 0, comment `w`] from [vesting.ton.org](https://vesting.ton.org/) interface.
    - d. Make sure you received remains on `vesting`.
8. Transfer the required amount of TON from the `vesting` contract to the `single_nominator_pool` for both cycles.
9. Wait for the validatorsâ€™ voting.
