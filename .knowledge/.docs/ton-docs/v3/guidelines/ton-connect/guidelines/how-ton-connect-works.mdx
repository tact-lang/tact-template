## Bird's eye view

**Apps** built on TON offer rich functionality, high performance, and are designed to protect user funds through smart contracts. Since these apps use decentralized technologies like blockchain, they are typically referred to as decentralized applications (dApps).

**Wallets** offer the user interface for approving transactions and securely store users' cryptographic keys on their personal devices.
This separation of responsibilities allows for rapid innovation and a high level of security: wallets don't need to create closed ecosystems, and apps don't need to bear the risk of holding users' accounts.

TON Connect is designed to provide a seamless user experience between wallets and apps.
