# ADNL UDP - Internode

ADNL over UDP is used by nodes and TON components to communicate with each other. It is a low-level protocol on top of which other, higher-level TON protocols such as DHT and RLDP operate. 
In this article, we will learn how ADNL over UDP works for basic communication between nodes.

Unlike ADNL over TCP, in the UDP implementation, the handshake takes place in a different form, and an additional layer is used in the form of channels, but other principles are similar: 
encryption keys are also generated based on our private key and the peer's public key, which is known in advance from the config or received from other network nodes.

In the UDP version of ADNL, the connection is established in the same time with the receiving of initial data from the peer if the initiator sent 'create channel' message, the channel's key will be calculated and the channel creation will be confirmed.
When the channel is established, further communication will continue inside it.

## Packet structure and communication

### First packets
Let's analyze the initialization of the connection with the DHT node and obtaining a signed list of its addresses in order to understand how the protocol works.

Find the node you like in [global config](https://ton-blockchain.github.io/global.config.json), in the `dht.nodes` section. For example:
```json
{
  "@type": "dht.node",
  "id": {
    "@type": "pub.ed25519",
    "key": "fZnkoIAxrTd4xeBgVpZFRm5SvVvSx7eN3Vbe8c83YMk="
  },
  "addr_list": {
    "@type": "adnl.addressList",
    "addrs": [
      {
        "@type": "adnl.address.udp",
        "ip": 1091897261,
        "port": 15813
      }
    ],
    "version": 0,
    "reinit_date": 0,
    "priority": 0,
    "expire_at": 0
  },
  "version": -1,
  "signature": "cmaMrV/9wuaHOOyXYjoxBnckJktJqrQZ2i+YaY3ehIyiL3LkW81OQ91vm8zzsx1kwwadGZNzgq4hI4PCB/U5Dw=="
}
```

1. Let's take its ED25519 key, `fZnkoIAxrTd4xeBgVpZFRm5SvVvSx7eN3Vbe8c83YMk`, and decode it from base64
2. Take its IP address `1091897261` and translate it into an understandable format using [service](https://www.browserling.com/tools/dec-to-ip) or using conversion to little endian bytes, we will get `65.21.7.173`
3. Combine with the port, get `65.21.7.173:15813` and establish a UDP connection.

We want to open a channel to communicate with node and get some information, and as the main task - to receive a list of signed addresses from it. To do this, we will generate 2 messages, the first - [create a channel](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/tl/generate/scheme/ton_api.tl#L129):
```tlb
adnl.message.createChannel key:int256 date:int = adnl.Message
```
Here we have 2 parameters - key and date. As a date, we will specify the current unix timestamp. And for the key - we need to generate a new ED25519 private+public key pair specially for the channel, they will be used for initialization of [public encryption key](/v3/documentation/network/protocols/adnl/adnl-tcp#getting-a-shared-key-using-ecdh). We will use our generated public key in the `key` parameter of the message, and just save the private one for now.

Serialize the filled TL structure and get:
```
bbc373e6                                                         -- TL ID adnl.message.createChannel 
d59d8e3991be20b54dde8b78b3af18b379a62fa30e64af361c75452f6af019d7 -- key
555c8763                                                         -- date
```

Next, let's move to our main query - [get a list of addresses](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/tl/generate/scheme/ton_api.tl#L198). 
To execute it, we first need to serialize its TL structure:
```tlb
dht.getSignedAddressList = dht.Node
```
It has no parameters, so we just serialize it. It will be just its id - `ed4879a9`.

Next, since this is a higher level request of the DHT protocol, we need to first wrap it in an `adnl.message.query` TL structure:
```tlb
adnl.message.query query_id:int256 query:bytes = adnl.Message
```
As `query_id` we generate random 32 bytes, as `query` we use our main request, [wrapped as an array of bytes](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tl#encoding-bytes-array).
We will get:
```
7af98bb4                                                         -- TL ID adnl.message.query
d7be82afbc80516ebca39784b8e2209886a69601251571444514b7f17fcd8875 -- query_id
04 ed4879a9 000000                                               -- query
```

### Building the packet

All communication is carried out using packets, the content of which is [TL structure](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/tl/generate/scheme/ton_api.tl#L81):
```tlb
adnl.packetContents 
  rand1:bytes                                     -- random 7 or 15 bytes
  flags:#                                         -- bit flags, used to determine the presence of fields further
  from:flags.0?PublicKey                          -- sender's public key
  from_short:flags.1?adnl.id.short                -- sender's ID
  message:flags.2?adnl.Message                    -- message (used if there is only one message)
  messages:flags.3?(vector adnl.Message)          -- messages (if there are > 1)
  address:flags.4?adnl.addressList                -- list of our addresses
  priority_address:flags.5?adnl.addressList       -- priority list of our addresses
  seqno:flags.6?long                              -- packet sequence number
  confirm_seqno:flags.7?long                      -- sequence number of the last packet received
  recv_addr_list_version:flags.8?int              -- address version 
  recv_priority_addr_list_version:flags.9?int     -- priority address version
  reinit_date:flags.10?int                        -- connection reinitialization date (counter reset)
  dst_reinit_date:flags.10?int                    -- connection reinitialization date from the last received packet
  signature:flags.11?bytes                        -- signature
  rand2:bytes                                     -- random 7 or 15 bytes
        = adnl.PacketContents
        
```

Once we have serialized all the messages we want to send, we can start building the packet. 
Packets to be sent to a channel differ in content from packets that are sent before the channel is initialized. 
First, let's analyze the main packet, which is used for initialization.

During the initial data exchange, outside the channel, the serialized content structure of the packet is prefixed with the public key of the peer - 32 bytes. 
Our public key is 32 bytes, the sha256 hash of the serialized TL of the content structure of the packet - 32 bytes. 
The content of the packet is encrypted using the [shared key](/v3/documentation/network/protocols/adnl/adnl-tcp#getting-a-shared-key-using-ecdh), obtained from our private key and the public key of the server.

Serialize our packet content structure, and parse it byte by byte:

```
After serialization - we need to sign the resulting byte array with our private client's (not channel's) ED25519 key, which we generated and saved before. 
After we have generated the signature (64 bytes in size), we need to add it to the packet, serialize it again, but now add the 11th bit to the flag, which means the presence of the signature:

```
Now we have an assembled, signed and serialized packet, which is an array of bytes. 
For subsequent verification of its integrity by the recipient, we need to calculate packet's sha256 hash. For example, let this be `408a2a4ed623b25a2e2ba8bbe92d01a3b5dbd22c97525092ac3203ce4044dcd2`.

Now let's encrypt the content of our packet with the AES-CTR cipher, using [shared key](/v3/documentation/network/protocols/adnl/adnl-tcp#getting-a-shared-key-using-ecdh), obtained from our private key and the public key of the peer (not the channel's key).

We are almost ready for sending, just remains to [calculate ID](/v3/documentation/network/protocols/adnl/adnl-tcp#getting-key-id) of ED25519 peer key and concat everything together:
```
daa76538d99c79ea097a67086ec05acca12d1fefdbc9c96a76ab5a12e66c7ebb  -- server Key ID
afc46336dd352049b366c7fd3fc1b143a518f0d02d9faef896cb0155488915d6  -- our public key
408a2a4ed623b25a2e2ba8bbe92d01a3b5dbd22c97525092ac3203ce4044dcd2  -- sha256 content hash (before encryption)
...                                                               -- encrypted content of the packet
```
Now we can send our built packet to peer via UDP, and wait for a response.

In response, we will receive a packet with similar structure, but with different messages. It will consist of:
```
68426d4906bafbd5fe25baf9e0608cf24fffa7eca0aece70765d64f61f82f005  -- ID of our key
2d11e4a08031ad3778c5e060569645466e52bd1bd2c7b78ddd56def1cf3760c9  -- server public key, for shared key

...                                                               -- the encrypted content of the packet
```

The deserialization of the packet from the server is as follows:
1. We check the ID of the key from the packet to understand that the packet is for us.
2. Using the public key of the server from the packet and our private key, we calculate a shared key and decrypt the content of the packet
3. Compare the sha256 hash sent to us with the hash received from the decrypted data, they must match
4. Start deserializing the packet content using the `adnl.packetContents` TL schema

The content of the packet will look like this:

The server responded to us with two messages: `adnl.message.confirmChannel` and `adnl.message.answer`. 
With `adnl.message.answer` everything is simple, this is the answer to our request `dht.getSignedAddressList`, we will analyze it in the article about DHT.

Let's focus on `adnl.message.confirmChannel`, which means that the peer has confirmed the creation of the channel and sent us its public channel key. Now, having our private channel key and the peer's public channel key, we can calculate the [shared key](/v3/documentation/network/protocols/adnl/adnl-tcp#getting-a-shared-key-using-ecdh).

Now when we have calculated the shared channel key, we need to make 2 keys out of it - one for encrypting outgoing messages, the other for decrypting incoming messages. 
Making 2 keys out of it is quite simple, the second key is equal to the shared key written in reverse order. Example:
```
Shared key : AABB2233

First key: AABB2233
Second key: 3322BBAA
```
It remains to determine which key to use for what, we can do this by comparing the id of our public channel key with the id of the public key of the server channel, converting them to a numerical form - uint256. This approach is used to ensure that both the server and the client determine which key to use for what. If the server uses the first key for encryption, then with this approach the client will always use it for decryption.

The terms of use are:
```
The server id is smaller than our id:
Encryption: First Key
Decryption: Second Key

The server id is larger than our id:
Encryption: Second Key
Decryption: First Key

If the ids are equal (nearly impossible):
Encryption: First Key
Decryption: First Key
```

### Communication in a channel

All subsequent packet exchange will occur within the channel, and channel keys will be used for encryption. 
Let's send the same `dht.getSignedAddressList` request inside a newly created channel to see the difference.

Let's build the packet for the channel using the same `adnl.packetContents` structure:
```
89cd42d1                                                               -- TL ID adnl.packetContents
0f c1fbe8c4ab8f8e733de83abac17915                                      -- rand1, 15 (0f) random bytes
c4000000                                                               -- flags (0x00c4) -> 0b0000000011000100
                                                                       -- message (because second bit = 1)
7af98bb4                                                                  -- TL ID adnl.message.query
fe3c0f39a89917b7f393533d1d06b605b673ffae8bbfab210150fe9d29083c35          -- query_id
04 ed4879a9 000000                                                        -- query (our dht.getSignedAddressList packed in bytes with padding 3)
0200000000000000                                                       -- seqno (because flag's sixth bit = 1), 2 because it is our second message
0100000000000000                                                       -- confirm_seqno (flag's seventh bit = 1), 1 because it is the last seqno received from the server
07 e4092842a8ae18                                                      -- rand2, 7 (07) random bytes
```
The packets in a channel are quite simple and essentially consist of sequences (seqno) and the messages themselves.

After serialization, like last time, we calculate the sha256 hash of the packet. Then we encrypt the packet using the key intended for the outgoing packets of the channel. 
[Calculate](/v3/documentation/network/protocols/adnl/adnl-tcp#getting-key-id) `pub.aes` ID of encryption key of our outgoing messages, and we build our packet:
```
bcd1cf47b9e657200ba21d94b822052cf553a548f51f539423c8139a83162180 -- ID of encryption key of our outgoing messages 
6185385aeee5faae7992eb350f26ba253e8c7c5fa1e3e1879d9a0666b9bd6080 -- sha256 content hash (before encryption)
...                                                              -- the encrypted content of the packet
```
We send a packet via UDP and wait for a response. In response, we will receive a packet of the same type as we sent (the same fields), but with the answer to our request `dht.getSignedAddressList`.

## Other message types
For basic communication, messages like `adnl.message.query` and `adnl.message.answer` are used, which we discussed above, but other types of messages are also used for some situations, which we will discuss in this section.

### adnl.message.part
This message type is a piece of one of the other possible message types, such as `adnl.message.answer`. This method of data transferring is used when the message is too large to be transmitted in a single UDP datagram.
```tlb
adnl.message.part 
hash:int256            -- sha256 hash of the original message
total_size:int         -- original message size
offset:int             -- offset according to the beginning of the original message
data:bytes             -- piece of data of the original message
   = adnl.Message;
```
Thus, in order to assemble the original message, we need to get several parts and, according to the offsets, concat them into a single bytes array. 
And then process it as a message (according to the ID prefix in this bytes array).

### adnl.message.custom
```tlb
adnl.message.custom data:bytes = adnl.Message;
```
Such messages are used when the logic at the higher level does not correspond to the request-response format, messages of this type allow you to completely move the processing to the higher level, since the message carries only an array of bytes, without query_id and other fields. 
Messages of this type are used, for example, in RLDP, since there can be only one response to many requests, this logic is controlled by RLDP itself.

### Conclusion

Further communication takes place on the basis of the logic described in this article,
but the content of the packets depends on higher level protocols such as DHT and RLDP.
