# TON Documentation

Welcome to the official TON Blockchain development documentation!

This resource aims to provide all the necessary information you'll need to build, test, and deploy applications on the TON Blockchain.

This is a collaborative, open-source initiative, and contributions are always welcome. All documentation can be edited via GitHub — [follow these instructions](/v3/contribute).

- _TON Hello World_ series provides detailed step-by-step guides to wallets, smart contracts, mini apps, and testing & debugging smart contracts on TON.
- _Get Started with TON_ is a step-by-step guide to interacting with TON Blockchain. (video tutorial included)

## Smart Contracts Development

Smart contracts are the building blocks of decentralized applications (DApps) on TON Blockchain. If you're looking to develop your own dApps, it's essential to understand how smart contracts work.

* [Speed Run TON](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/examples) - 6 interactive challenges and step-by-step tutorials to learn smart contracts development.

## DApp Development

Decentralized applications (DApps) are applications that run on a peer-to-peer network of computers rather than a single computer (TON Blockchain). They are similar to traditional web applications, but they are built on top of a blockchain network. This means that DApps are decentralized, meaning that no single entity controls them.
