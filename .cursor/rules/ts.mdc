### 1. **Using Tact for Smart Contracts**  
Tact is a specialized language for writing smart contracts on the TON blockchain. For a detailed guide on writing Tact contracts, refer to [tact.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/tact.mdc).  
- **Syntax & Types**: Tact provides a cleaner syntax and type safety, ensuring reliable on-chain execution.  
- **Reserved Keywords**: `fun`, `let`, `return`, `message`, `receive` and more.  
- **Security**: Built-in checks and strong typing minimize common pitfalls.

---

### 2. **Testing Tact Contracts with TypeScript**  
Though ` [tact.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/tact.mdc) ` focuses on contract creation, you can still leverage TypeScript to:  
- **Compile** your Tact contracts (`yarn build`) to generate `.boc` or `.fift` outputs and TypeScript definitions.  
- **Write and run tests** using [Jest](mdc:https:/jestjs.io) or other frameworks:
  1. **Local environment**: `@ton/sandbox` or `ton-emulator` to simulate on-chain behavior.  
  2. **Integration tests**: Using `@ton/test-utils` or custom scripts to check real blockchain interactions.  
- **Debug & Verify** contract logic, ensuring Tact’s typed features align with expected results.

```typescript
import { blockchainTest } from "@ton/test-utils"; 
import { MyContract } from "../output/MyContract";

blockchainTest("Tact contract test", async (client) => {
  const deployer = client.sender(<owner-private-key>);
  const contract = client.deployContract(MyContract.create(), deployer);

  await contract.methods.increment().send();
  const value = await contract.methods.getCounter().call();

  expect(value).toBe(1);
});

### 3. **Core TON & TypeScript Libraries**

| Library               | Description                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `@ton/core`           | Base SDK for addresses, cells, and transactions     |
| `@ton/sandbox`        | Local sandbox for contract testing                  |
| `ton-emulator`        | Simulation tool for on-chain execution              |
| `@tact-lang/deployer` | Deployment utilities for **Tact**-written contracts |
| `@ton/test-utils`     | Tools for integration testing of contracts          |
| `ton-crypto`          | Cryptographic helpers (signatures, hashing)         |
| `jest` / `vitest`     | JavaScript/TypeScript testing frameworks            |
| `dotenv`              | Environment variable handling                       |

### 4. **Recommended Workflow**

1. **Write** your Tact contract (refer to [tact.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/tact.mdc) for syntax).
2. **Build** it (`yarn build`), generating TypeScript typings and compiled artifacts.
3. **Write tests** (`*.spec.ts`) using Jest or a similar framework:
   - Import the compiled contract.
   - Deploy locally with `@ton/sandbox` or `ton-emulator`.
   - Interact with contract methods and verify state changes.
4. **Deploy** the contract using `@tact-lang/deployer` when ready for production.

---

### 5. **Deployment & Interaction**

Once tested locally:

```bash
yarn build
yarn deploy
```

- **`yarn build`** regenerates contract code and TypeScript wrappers.
- **`yarn deploy`** runs the deployment script, pushing the contract onto the TON blockchain.

To interact after deployment:

```typescript
const client = new TonClient4(...);
const contract = new MyContract(client, contractAddress);

const result = await contract.getCounter();
console.log("Counter value:", result);
```

---

### 6. **Conclusion**

- **Tact**: Reliable, typed environment for TON smart contracts.
- **TypeScript**: Test, deploy, and maintain using the TON ecosystem’s powerful libraries.
- **Testing**: Combine Tact’s typed approach with local sandboxes (`@ton/sandbox`, `ton-emulator`) for robust end-to-end coverage.

This ensures a **high-confidence development workflow** for TON-based smart contracts, bridging Tact’s security and TypeScript’s rich tooling.
